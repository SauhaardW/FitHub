# Sprint 1 - Sprint Planning Meeting

## Summary
- We met on Monday, 26th September, at 3pm to plan the Goals and Tasks for Sprint 1. 
- All the members of our Team – FitHub were present and participated at this meeting.
- Identified the most crucial User Stories to begin our work for the forthcoming Sprint.
- These User stories were identified after all members indicated the one’s they found were key for our web-application. After this process, a vote was taken to narrow it down to 6 user stories.
- The User Stories we planned to work on for Sprint 1 are:
    - As a young beginner, I would like to have an easy registration flow so that I can get started easily and begin working out.
    - As an inexperienced tech user, I would like to be able to log in easily so that I can gain access to my workouts quickly.
    - As an inexperienced tech user, I would like to be able to log out so that my husband can sign into his account from my phone.
    - As an inexperienced tech user, I would like to have a profile page so I can see and edit my account’s details.
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to be able to see a list of my friends and search for users to send friend requests to and accept incoming friend requests.
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to be able to schedule workouts with my friends (by seeing a list of my friends to choose from), which will appear in both our calendars.

## Sprint Goal

To create the basis of the most crucial components (User-stories) of our web-application. For Sprint 1, we want to create fundamental functionalities so that we can build up on it. These include registration of a user, login, logout, navigation (navigating from one page to another using hamburger menu), displaying a user’s friends list, searching for a user, and sending friend requests.


## Task Distribution

- We noticed that some of the User stories were too big to be worked on individually. Therefore, we broke each of the user stories into smaller tasks.
- The User story itself were listed as tasks on JIRA Sprint board for Sprint 1.
- The tasks associated with each User story, were listed as sub-tasks for the corresponding user-story(task) on JIRA.
- Apart from the JIRA tasks/sub-tasks, we had to identify the list of documentations we needed to work on to complete our documentation for Sprint 1.
- In order to divide the tasks, each individual identified the tasks/sub-tasks/documents they wanted to work on. The conflicts were resolved by taking a vote. Care was taken, to distribute the tasks evenly.

## Team Capacity
Since this was our first sprint with point estimates, the average completed story points is the total completed story points for Sprint 1. Therefore:
```
Sprint Velocity = 102
Team Capacity = 6*8 = 48
Focus Factor = Sprint Velocity / Team Capacity = 102 / 48 = 2.125
Effective Team Capacity = 2.125*(6*8*8) = 816h
```

Since this is the first sprint, we have an inflated Sprint Velocity which will drop when we take the average. This results in an overestimation of our Effective Team Capacity. We are working on a refined point estimation strategy for the upcoming sprints.
