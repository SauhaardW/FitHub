Existing Products: 
1. Sworkit- targets only young beginners by offering home workouts, it doesn't include exercises with gym equipment. As it doesn't help with gym equipment, this app is not useful to Advanced gymgoers at all. 

2. Freeletics- it is an app with a very complicated registration page and user experience and it only recommends hard exercises that are useful to advanced trainees, and so is not meant for young beginners or inexperienced tech users at all.
 
3. MyFitnessPal- mainly focuses on the nutrition progress of an individual. Limited variety of workouts offered and no scheduling workouts. It also doesn't have a weekly workout plan that you can follow, it is more suited for advanced gymgoers only.

4. Strong - This app is easy to use as a beginner and allows you to create workouts and track your sets, reps, and weight. However, it does have any friends feature and it does not support scheduling workouts (whether that be an individual workout or workout with another person). This may make it difficult for beginners to keep consistent since they have no schedule. 

How FitHub differentiates itself from the competition for users:
1. Beginner- Fithub provides everything from workout plans to information about exercises, in the form of tooltip information boxes, which helps a beginner in starting their journey. Fithub also has an option of adding their friend by sending a friend request, which will motivate them as they will have an option of working out together with their friends by scheduling workouts together.

2. Inexperienced tech users- Fithub provides a simple and easy user experience and registration flow. It's so simple that even inexperienced tech users can use it without needing any tutorial. To make things even easier for them, Fithub provides them with various statistical graphs to track their progress.
 
3. Advanced gymgoer- Fithub provides tracking progress efficiently, relating to all aspects of exercising from weights to the number of repetitions, etc.
It also provides an option to export their gym workout in shareable plain text format so that they can have an offline copy in case they need it or they can also share their workouts with their friends. They can also work out with other advanced gymgoers by adding them as friends.


Fithub is a platform that gives an option of working out with your friends by scheduling workouts together and sharing your workouts with your friends, while also providing other important features like recommending workouts, an option of creating multiple workouts daily, etc, and providing a smooth and easy user experience with graphs and other statistical tools.
While other applications are majorly focused on 1 or 2 of the user mentioned above, we are incorporating the needs of all these users because after some point, users will advance from one category to another, a beginner will eventually turn into an advanced trainee, and it eliminates the need to download an app that provides a routine for a higher level and the need to manually enter their previous progress onto another platform.
