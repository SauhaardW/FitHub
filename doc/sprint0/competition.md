Existing Products: 
1. Sworkit- targets only young beginners by offering home workouts, this app is not useful to Advanced gymgoer at all. (does not cover the use of gym equipment)
2. Freeletics- only targets advanced trainees, is not good for young beginners or inexperienced tech users at all. 
3. MyFitnessPal- mainly focuses on the nutrition progress of an individual. Limited variety of workouts offered and no scheduling workouts. It also doesn't have a weekly workout plan that you can follow, it is more suited for advanced gymgoers only.
4. 7 minute workout- given beginners lack motivation and discipline to workout regularly, this app is based on willingness to workout. It does not set a schedule or regular routine. 

Users:
1. Beginners: provides information specific to the gym (including usage of equipment and workouts that target different sets of muscles and more). Also after choosing their split, they won't be able to change any workout during that week. This will help prevent injuries and confusion and give the beginners the clarity about workout splits.
2. inexperienced tech users: provides an easy way to track progress with various graphs and to access workouts and information efficiently. 
3. Advanced gymgoer: provides tracking progress relating to all aspects. (eg. weights to number of repetiton, muscle mass etc.) and also provides an option to export their gym history in shareable plain text format.




The competitors only focused on one of the three users mentioned above so that all the features of the app are accurately used by the audience. For example, a beginner should avoid the temptation to do advanced workouts which may result serious consequences if done incorrectly. Additionally, it would take a lot more resources and time to include every user and limit the features of each user while still making the app easy to manage. We are targetting all of these users because after some point, users will advance from one category to another (example- a beginner will eventually turn into advanced trainee) and it eliminates the need to download an app that provides a routine for a higher level and the need to manually enter their previous progress onto another platform.
