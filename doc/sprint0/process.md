# Team Organization 

Everyone knew each other before we could have enrolled ourselves for the course. We connected using Discord to split our responsibilities. All the responsibilities were split on the basis of who is the most comfortable with the task. In the case where more than one individual wants to pick a task, a meeting shall be hosted via Discord to resolve the conflict. If the conflict cannot be resolved then the task will be randomly assigned.


# Tasks for Sprint 0 

Alina Buzila: team-contract.pdf, User experience & UI,  PB.md, team.md

# Tools  

All discussions and document/url sharing took place on our Discord channel. This made it convenient to work together and sign documents like the team-contract.pdf.
UI/UX design was done on Figma. This gave us a basic preview of the functionality and theme which will be changed as per the product ownerâ€™s requirements. 


# Decision Making 

All decisions will be made by hosting meetings. In the case of a discrepancy, a discussion will be hosted to point out the contrasting views and later a vote will be taken to come to a final decision.


# Points for User Stories  

For each sprint, the user stories will be pulled from the product backlog to the to-do category. We will then host a meeting wherein a planning poker shall be organized. Fibonacci numbers will be used to assign points for the user stories based on the level of difficulty. All the assigned points will be in comparison to a task, Ex: Frontend for the login page.


# Voting for point estimate 

On average we have 2 voting rounds. In the case of a discrepancy, we held a discussion to put forth the contrasting views and smooth things over. Once the differences were resolved we held another round for voting.


# Frequency of meetings

We host 2 scrum calls during the week(Monday 5pm-6pm Wednesday 8pm-9pm) to track our progress and discuss future responsibilities.

Apart from the scrum calls, we will host occasional meetings on discord wherein difficulties pertaining to tasks will be resolved by team members, if they cannot be easily resolved through text.

Our first scrum call was held on 19th September, where we split the responsibilities for Sprint 0. In our second scrum call, 21st September,  we worked on the UI design of our application on Figma.

# Lessons for next Phase

A crucial lesson to take forward is to start work early for the upcoming phase. The start of each phase should be accompanied by a team meeting to clear doubts on the  assigned tasks. It is essential to clear all the discrepancies early on to avoid delays later in the sprint. If a team member is stuck on an issue, he/she will approach other team members to resolve the issue at the earliest.
