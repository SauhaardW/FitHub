# How did you organize the team?  

Everyone knew each other before we could have enrolled ourselves for the course. We connected using Discord to split our responsibilities. All the responsibilities were split on the basis of who is the most comfortable with the task. In the case where more than one individual wants to pick a task, a meeting shall be hosted via Discord to resolve the conflict. If the conflict cannot be resolved then the task will be randomly assigned.


# How tasks were divided for Sprint 0: 

Alina Buzila: team-contract.pdf, User experience & UI,  PB.md, team.md

Andres Prada:  README.md, done.md, User experience & UI, setup(backend, frontend),  PB.md, team.md

Manas Khandelwal: competition.md, User experience & UI,  PB.md, team.md

Sauhard Walia: personas.pdf, User experience & UI,  PB.md, team.md

Sayed Mojtaba Hosseini: process.md, User experience & UI,  PB.md, team.md

Yuval Kamani: summary.md, User experience & UI,  PB.md, team.md


# Which tools did you use, if any?  

All discussions and document/url sharing took place on our Discord channel. This made it convenient to work together and sign documents like the team-contract.pdf.
UI/UX design was done on Figma. This gave us a basic preview of the functionality and theme which will be changed as per the product ownerâ€™s requirements. 


# How did you make decisions?  

All decisions will be made by hosting meetings. In the case of a discrepancy, a discussion will be hosted to point out the contrasting views and later a vote will be taken to come to a final decision.


# How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?  

For each sprint, the user stories will be pulled from the product backlog to the to-do category. We will then host a meeting wherein a planning poker shall be organized. Fibonacci numbers will be used to assign points for the user stories based on the level of difficulty. All the assigned points will be in comparison to a task, Ex: Frontend for the login page.


# How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?  

On average we have 2 voting rounds. In the case of a discrepancy, we held a discussion to put forth the contrasting views and smooth things over. Once the differences were resolved we held another round for voting.


# How frequently did you meet?  

We host 2 scrum calls during the week(Monday 5pm-6pm Wednesday 8pm-9pm) to track our progress and discuss future responsibilities.

Apart from the scrum calls, we will host occasional meetings on discord wherein difficulties pertaining to tasks will be resolved by team members, if they cannot be easily resolved through text.

Our first scrum call was held on 19th September, where we split the responsibilities for Sprint 0. In our second scrum call, 21st September,  we worked on the UI design of our application on Figma.

# What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? 

A crucial lesson to take forward is to start work early for the upcoming phase. The start of each phase should be accompanied by a team meeting to clear doubts on the  assigned tasks. It is essential to clear all the discrepancies early on to avoid delays later in the sprint. If a team member is stuck on an issue, he/she will approach other team members to resolve the issue at the earliest.
