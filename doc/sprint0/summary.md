## Objective

Build an end-all solution to workout tracking and incorporating the social aspect of going to the gym. The application allows one to create personal workouts, log workouts, track progress, schedule workouts with friends and a streak count to keep the user motivated.

## Key Personas

1. **Francesca Audrey -** a 20 year-old student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She was captain of her highschool cheerleading team and got out of shape due to the immense university workload and other commitments. Her goal is to start going to the gym and track her progress to get back in shape, and get into the university cheerleading team.
2. **Barbara Jane Smith -** a 78 year-old retired highschool teacher that has not been able to keep up with the technological advancements. She faced a lot of pain in her left ankle and was recommended to incorporate some exercises into her daily life. Due to her inexperience in gym and technology, she wants an easy-to-use application that has all the exercises she needs to do.
3. **Dwayne Coleman -** a 28 year-old Sales and Trading Analyst working at TD Bank and is an experienced gym-goer for 8 years. Recently, he started to notice that he is unhappy with his progress and his application doesn’t accurately track the muscle group he has been targeting.

## Key Scenarios

1. Dwayne is a long-time family friend of Francesca and they meet at least once a week for lunch. One day, Francesca mentioned that she started going to the gym and follows the pre-made workouts on FitHub. However, she was also curious about Dwyane’s workout structure and learn from his workouts, so she can send him a request to schedule a time together.
2. After an unsatisfying experience with out-dated fitness applications, Dwayne wants a platform he can trust and track his development to make home look even bigger than he is. Additionally, he wants to log his workouts so that he has a record of how many exercises and what weights he does. A clear progression chart would motivate him further to go to the gym consistently and push himself harder.
3. Barbara Smith’s friend, Ms. Lara, not only recommended her to join a gym, but also introduced her to some inexperienced tech-users that also go to the gym. Together, they use FitHub to schedule a certain time everyday and meet as a group to get fit together. This brings people closer, encourages one to get some exercise, leading to a healthier lifestyle overall. Additionally, the streaks count is a small touch that adds extra motivation because it is a sign of hard work and it is tough to break it.

## Key Principles

1. Easy navigation, smooth design and accessible system for all users.
2. Thorough testing to neglect all errors and allowing a satisfactory user experience.
