# Sprint 3 - Sprint Planning Meeting

## Summary
- We met on Sunday, 23rd October, at 6pm to plan the Goals and Tasks for Sprint 3. 
- All the members of our Team – FitHub were present and participated at this meeting.
- Identified the most crucial User Stories to begin our work for the forthcoming Sprint
- These User stories were identified after all members agreed on the user stories to be taken from the product backlog based on their assigned priorities after the planning poker.
- **Note: We made modifications to our user stories by adding/editing existing user stories in our PB.md from Sprint 0.**
- The **NEW** User Stories we planned to work on for Sprint 2 are:
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to be able to log my current weight, BMI, and height so that I can see my progress at a future date.
    - As an experienced gymgoer, I'd like to be able to export my workout routine to plain text so that I can share it with my friends and have an offline copy.
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to be able to click on a workout that is displayed on the home page or workouts page to log my workout by tracking the weight and number of repetitions I do per set of an exercise.
    - As a young beginner, I'd like to be able to see a like to dislike ratio for pre-made workouts so that I can easily determine if I want to do them. 
    - As a beginner, I would like to see the instructions for each exercise when I view/start a workout.

## Sprint Goal
For Sprint 3, we want to build on the fundamental functionlalities that we created for our web-application from Sprint 1 and Sprint 2. We would like to build new features in our application that make our app unique such as: Being able to like and dislike recommended workouts and see the like ratio for it, being able to export the workout in plain text to clipboard, being able to log body statistics for a user, being able to log a workout, being able to view the instruction of a workout.

## Task Distribution
- We noticed that some of the User stories were too big to be worked on individually. Therefore, we broke each of the user stories into smaller tasks.
- The User story itself were listed as tasks on Trello Sprint board for Sprint 3.
- The tasks associated with each User story, were listed as sub-tasks for the corresponding user-story(task) on Trello.
- Apart from the Trello tasks/sub-tasks, we had to identify the list of documentations we needed to work on to complete our documentation for Sprint 3.
- In order to divide the tasks, each individual identified the tasks/sub-tasks/documents they wanted to work on. The conflicts were resolved by taking a vote. Care was taken, to distribute the tasks evenly based on story points associated with each task.

## Team Capacity
```
Points completed in Sprint 1: 102
Points completed in Sprint 2: 85
Points completed in Sprint 2: 74


Average: (102 + 85 + 74)/ 3 = 87

Sprint Velocity = 87 
Team Capacity = 6*8 = 48
Focus Factor = Sprint Velocity / Team Capacity = 87 / 48 = 1.8125
Effective Team Capacity = 1.8125 *(6*8*8) = 696h
```

Our Estimate is now much better compared to the first 2 sprints.
