# Sprint 4 - Sprint Planning Meeting

## Summary
- We met on Sunday, 6th November, at 8pm to plan the Goals and Tasks for Sprint 4. 
- All the members of our Team – FitHub were present and participated at this meeting.
- Identified the most crucial User Stories to begin our work for the last Sprint
- These User stories were identified after all members agreed on the user stories to be taken from the product backlog based on their assigned priorities after the planning poker.
- The **NEW** User Stories we planned to work on for Sprint 4 are:
    - As a young beginner, I'd like to be able to see my past bodyweight, height, BMI logs from a statistics page, so that I can know how well I'm doing.
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to be able to see bodyweight, height, and BMI graphs with data from the last month on my home page.
    - As any gymgoer, when completing and logging a workout, I would like to be able to see my previous weight and personal record weight lifted on each set of each of my exercises to know how much I want to lift on each of my sets that day.
    - As an experienced gymgoer, I'd like to be able to see the details (sets reps weight) of my previous months completed workouts so I can see how much I have improved in specific exercises and make the necessary modifications to my workouts.
    - As a beginner gymgoer, I would like to see my “streak” (the amount of days in a row (up to today) that I have worked out) on the profile, home, and history page to help stay motivated and complete today’s workout.
- We also created a task in our trello backlog for this sprint for fixing minor bugs that were part of our application. 

## Sprint Goal
For Sprint 4, we want to build on the fundamental functionlalities that we created for our web-application from Sprint 1, Sprint 2 and Sprint 3. Since this was our last sprint, we had to complete the remaining user stories in our product backlog. For this sprint we also added a few tasks in the sprint backlog that catered to rectifying minor bug fixes that persisted in our previous sprints. We wanted to complete our application for this sprint and rectify many bugs that persisted from the previous sprints. 

## Task Distribution
- We noticed that some of the User stories were too big to be worked on individually. Therefore, we broke each of the user stories into smaller tasks.
- The User story itself were listed as tasks on Trello Sprint board for Sprint 4.
- The tasks associated with each User story, were listed as sub-tasks for the corresponding user-story(task) on Trello.
- Apart from the Trello tasks/sub-tasks, we had to identify the list of documentations we needed to work on to complete our documentation for Sprint 4.
- In order to divide the tasks, each individual identified the tasks/sub-tasks/documents they wanted to work on. The conflicts were resolved by taking a vote. For this sprint, since some people had more time available, more tasks were allocated to them based on a mutual desicision among team memebers.

## Team Capacity
```
Points completed in Sprint 1: 102
Points completed in Sprint 2: 85
Points completed in Sprint 3: 74
Points completed in Sprint 4: 98


Average: (102 + 85 + 74 + 136)/ 4 = 89.75

Sprint Velocity = 89.75 
Team Capacity = 6*7 = 42
Focus Factor = Sprint Velocity / Team Capacity = 99.25 / 36 = 2.137
Effective Team Capacity = 2.137 *(6*7*6) = 538.5h
```

This is our final estimate.
