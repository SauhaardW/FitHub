# Sprint 2 - Sprint Planning Meeting

## Summary
- We met on Sunday, 9th October, at 8pm to plan the Goals and Tasks for Sprint 2. 
- All the members of our Team – FitHub were present and participated at this meeting.
- Identified the most crucial User Stories to begin our work for the forthcoming Sprint
- These User stories were identified after all members agreed on the user stories to be taken from the product backlog based on their assigned priorities after the planning poker.
- **Note: We made modifications to our user stories by adding/editing existing user stories in our PB.md from Sprint 0.**
- The User stories that we continued work on from Sprint 1 (Previous Sprint) are:
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to see my incoming friend requests on the friends page and accept them.
    - As an inexperienced tech user, I would like to have a profile page so I can see and edit my account’s details.
    - As a young beginner, I would like to have an easy registration flow so that I can get started easily and begin working out.
    - As any gymgoer using the application, I would like a topbar with a hamburger menu that allows me to navigate between pages of the application.
- The **NEW** User Stories we planned to work on for Sprint 2 are:
    - As an inexperienced tech user, I would like to be able to easily schedule workouts for myself or with friends. 
    - As a young beginner, I'd like to be provided beginner workouts, so that I don't have to give much thought to preparing them on my own.
    - As any gymgoer, I would like to be able to see my scheduled workouts in a calendar on my calendar page. 
    - As an experienced gymgoer, I would like to be able to filter by category (barbell, dumbbell, bodyweight), and muscle group (and search for) when selecting an exercise to add to a workout I am creating. 
    - As an experienced gymgoer, I'd like to be able to make my own workouts, choosing exercises from an exercise bank in whatever order I like. 

## Sprint Goal

To create the basis of the most crucial components (User-stories) of our web-application. For Sprint 1, we want to create fundamental functionalities so that we can build up on it. These include registration of a user, login, logout, navigation (navigating from one page to another using hamburger menu), displaying a user’s friends list, searching for a user, and sending friend requests.


## Task Distribution

- We noticed that some of the User stories were too big to be worked on individually. Therefore, we broke each of the user stories into smaller tasks.
- The User story itself were listed as tasks on Trello Sprint board for Sprint 2.
- The tasks associated with each User story, were listed as sub-tasks for the corresponding user-story(task) on Trello.
- Apart from the Trello tasks/sub-tasks, we had to identify the list of documentations we needed to work on to complete our documentation for Sprint 2.
- In order to divide the tasks, each individual identified the tasks/sub-tasks/documents they wanted to work on. The conflicts were resolved by taking a vote. Care was taken, to distribute the tasks evenly based on story points associated with each task.

## Team Capacity
Since this was our first sprint with point estimates, the average completed story points is the total completed story points for Sprint 1. Therefore:
```
Points completed in Sprint 1: 102
Points completed in Sprint 2: 85

Average: (102 + 85)/ 2 = 93.5

Sprint Velocity = 93.5 
Team Capacity = 6*8 = 48
Focus Factor = Sprint Velocity / Team Capacity = 93.5 / 48 = 1.948
Effective Team Capacity = 1.948 *(6*8*8) = 748h
```

This is still an overestimate because the average is only over 2 Sprints. This will fall from Sprint 3 and we will have a better estimate.
